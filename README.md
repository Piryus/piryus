# Hey, I'm Emile 👋

Freelance Software Engineer based in Berlin.

I like building things that work well — lately I've been deep into AI/LLM tooling, but I'm equally happy wiring up APIs, optimizing systems, or just making something that didn't exist before.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me nerding out about startups and tech news.
